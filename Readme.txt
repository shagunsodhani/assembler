This repository contains the code of a SIC XE assembler implemented in C++ as a part of projects under Professor Vaskar Ray Chaudhary of EC Department of IIT Roorkee. The code does not implement a complete assembler, it provides a place to start from and build upon the assembler code as and how required. To explain how to use the code I have included two example programs as well.

The first example is about generating the opcode for a c++ program to generate the first  fibonacci numbers. The second example is abou checking wether an inputted string is a palindrome or not.

Feel free to use the code and ask me in case of any confusion.
